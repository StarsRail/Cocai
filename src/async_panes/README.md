# async_panes

This module provides utilities for managing asynchronous UI panes in the Cocai  "play" interface (see `public/play.html` for how it looks):

* "story so far" history summary.
* scene illustrations.

Refer to `main.py` for how these coroutines are wired onto the "user sent a message" event.
