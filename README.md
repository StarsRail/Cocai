In the first message, I asked Cocai to generate a character for me:

> Can you generate a character for me? Let's call him "Don Joe". Describe what kind of guy he is, then tabulate his stats.

Under the hood, Cocai used [Cochar](https://www.cochar.pl/). In the first couple of attempts, Cocai forgot to provide some required parameters. Cocai fixed that problem and successfully generated a character profile from Cochar.

Then, I asked Cocai what I -- playing the character of Mr. Don Joe -- can do, being stuck in a dark cave. It suggested a couple of options and described the potential outcomes associated with each choice.

I then asked Cocai to roll a skill check for me, Spot Hidden. Based on the chat history, Cocai was able to recall that Mr. Joe had a Spot Hidden skill of 85%. It rolled the dice, got a successful outcome, and took some inspiration from its 2nd response to progress the story.

Thanks to the chain-of-thought (CoT) visualization feature, you can unfold the tool-using steps and verify yourself that Cocai was indeed able to recall the precise value of Joe's Spot Hidden skill:

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

There are a couple of things you have to do manually before you can start using the chatbot.

1. Clone the repository ([how](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
2. **Install the required binary, standalone programs**. These are not Python packages, so they aren't managed by `pyproject.toml`.
3. **Self-serve a text embedding model**. This model "translates" your text into numbers, so that the computer can understand you.
4. **Choose a way to serve a large language model (LLM)**. You can either use OpenAI's API or self-host a local LLM with Ollama.
5. **Initialize secrets**.

No need to explicitly install Python packages. `uv`, the package manager of our choice, will implicitly install the required packages when you boot up the chatbot for the first time.

#### Install the required binary programs

These are the binary programs that you need to have ready before running Cocai:
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), a command runner. I use this because I always tend to forget the exact command to run.
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the Python package manager that Cocai uses. It does not require you to explicitly create a virtual environment.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Cocai requires many types of databases, e.g. object storage and vector storage, along with some containerized applications. We need the `docker-compose` command to orchestrate these containers.
- [Ollama][olm]. Doc ingestion and memories are relying on a local embedding model.
- (Optional) [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) and [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), if you ever want to run the chatbot the easy way (discussed later).

If you are on macOS, you can install these programs using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install just uv ollama tmuxinator
brew install --cask docker
```

Optionally, also install [Stable Diffusion Web UI][sdwu]. This allows the chatbot to generate illustrations.

[olm]: https://ollama.com/
[sdwu]: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui

#### Self-serve an embedding model

Ensure that you have a local Ollama server running (if not, start one with `ollama serve`). Then, download the [`nomic-embed-text`](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) model by running:

```shell
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

#### Bring your own large language model (LLM)

The easiest (and perhaps highest-quality) way would be to provide an API key to OpenAI. Simply add `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` to a `.env` file in the project root.

With the absence of an OpenAI API key, the chatbot will default to using [Ollama][olm], a program that serves LLMs locally.
- Ensure that your local Ollama server has already downloaded the `llama3.1` model. If you haven't (or aren't sure), run `ollama pull llama3.1`.
- If you want to use a different model that does not support function-calling, that's also possible. Revert [this commit][tc], so that you can use the ReAct paradigm to simulate function-calling capabilities with a purely semantic approach.

[tc]: https://github.com/StarsRail/Cocai/commit/13d777767d1dd96024021c085247525ec52b79ba

#### Prepare secrets

Run `chainlit create-secret` to generate a JWT token. Follow the instructions to add the secret to `.env`.

Start serving minIO for the first time (by running `minio server .minio/` if you have a local binary installed, or used Docker Compose command discussed below). Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:57393/access-keys` and create a new access key. (You may need to log in first. The default credentials can be found in [their official documentation][mod].) Add the access key and secret key to `.env`:

[mod]: https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-server/settings/root-credentials.html#id1

```toml
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="foo"
MINIO_SECRET_KEY="bar"
```

Optionally, if you want to enable the chatbot to search the internet, you can provide a Tavily API key. Add `TAVILY_API_KEY=...` to `.env`.

Optionally, if you prefer to use OpenAI ("GPT") as your LLM, add `OPENAI_API_KEY=...` to `.env`.

Optionally, if you prefer to use a hosted open LLM, you can try [Together.ai](https://www.together.ai/). Add `TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY=...` to `.env`.

### Running the Chatbot

There are 2 ways to start the chatbot, the easy way and the hard way.

In the easy way, **simply run `just serve-all`**. This will start all the required standalone programs and the chatbot in one go. Notes:
* **Use of multiplexer.** To avoid cluttering up your screen, we use a [terminal multiplexer][tmx] (`tmux`), which essentially divides your terminal window into panes, each running a separate program.
  The panes are defined in the file `tmuxinator.yaml`. [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) is a separate program that manages `tmux` sessions declaratively.
* **Don't use the Dockerfile**. For a tech demo, I hacked up a `Dockerfile`, which uses this `just serve-all` command. But the `tmuxinator.yaml` file had been updated since, and I'm pretty sure the Dockerfile is broken now.

<img width="1278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7db810d-4de0-432d-87f2-affc14e1daa9">

In the hard way, you want to create a separate terminal for each command:
1. Start serving **Ollama** by running `ollama serve`. It should be listening at `http://localhost:11434/v1`. Details:
   - This is for locally inferencing embedding & language models.
   - I did not containerize this because [Docker doesn't support GPUs in Apple Silicon](https://chariotsolutions.com/blog/post/apple-silicon-gpus-docker-and-ollama-pick-two/) (as of Feb 2024), which is what I'm using.
2. Start Docker containers by running `docker-compose up`. This includes:
   - **minIO** object database (for persisting data for our web frontend, including user credentials and chat history -- not thought chains, though)
   - **Arize Phoenix** platform (for debugging thought chains)
   - **Qdrant** vector database (for the chatbot's short-term memory -- this is implemented via `mem0`)
3. Optionally, start serving a "**Stable Diffusion web UI**" server with API support turned on by running `cd ../stable-diffusion-webui; ./webui.sh --api --nowebui --port 7860`.
   - This enables your AI Keeper to draw illustrations.
   - If Stable Diffusion is not running, the AI Keeper will still be able to generate text-based responses. It's just that it won't be able to draw illustrations.
4. Finally, start serving the **chatbot** by running `just serve`.

Either way, Cocai should be ready at `http://localhost:8000/chat/`. Log in with the dummy credentials `admin` and `admin`.

## Troubleshooting

If you see:

```
  File ".../llvmlite-0.43.0.tar.gz/ffi/build.py", line 142, in main_posix
    raise RuntimeError(msg) from None
RuntimeError: Could not find a `llvm-config` binary. There are a number of reasons this could occur, please see: https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/install.html#using-pip for help.
error: command '.../bin/python' failed with exit code 1
```

Then run:

```shell
brew install llvm
```

If your `uv run phoenix serve` command fails with:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Cocai/.venv/bin/phoenix", line 5, in <module>
    from phoenix.server.main import main
  File "Cocai/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/phoenix/__init__.py", line 12, in <module>
    from .session.session import (
  File ".venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/phoenix/session/session.py", line 41, in <module>
    from phoenix.core.model_schema_adapter import create_model_from_inferences
  File ".venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/phoenix/core/model_schema_adapter.py", line 11, in <module>
    from phoenix.core.model_schema import Embedding, Model, RetrievalEmbedding, Schema

    class ModelData(ObjectProxy, ABC):  # type: ignore
TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases
```

then you can work around the problem for now by [serving Arize Phoenix from a Docker container](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/deployment/docker):

```shell
docker run -p 6006:6006 -p 4317:4317 -i -t arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```
