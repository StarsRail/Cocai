# Recommended Skills for Common Situations

Situation: The players discover a mysterious, ancient artifact in a hidden chamber. It is covered in strange symbols and emits a faint, otherworldly glow.

**Suggested Skills:**
1. **Archaeology**
   - **Critical Success:** The player identifies the artifact as a powerful relic from a lost civilization and uncovers its true purpose. This knowledge provides a significant advantage in future encounters, as the artifact can be used to counter certain supernatural threats.
   - **Ordinary Success:** The player recognizes the artifact as something ancient and possibly valuable, though its exact origin remains unknown. The group is cautious but unsure of its full potential.
   - **Failure:** The player misinterprets the symbols, believing the artifact to be a harmless trinket. This leads to a false sense of security, potentially causing problems when the artifact's true nature is revealed.
   - **Fumble:** The player’s examination triggers a hidden mechanism in the artifact, unleashing a dangerous curse or summoning a malevolent entity.

2. **Occult**
   - **Extreme Success:** The player deciphers the symbols and realizes they are part of a ritual. They also understand how to safely control or use the artifact to protect the group from supernatural forces.
   - **Hard Success:** The player recognizes the artifact as tied to dark rituals and understands the risks involved. The group decides to handle it with extreme caution.
   - **Failure:** The player senses something strange about the artifact but cannot determine its purpose. This uncertainty causes unease among the group.
   - **Fumble:** The player mistakes the artifact for a harmless relic, and attempting to use it inadvertently invites dark forces or causes psychological harm.

3. **Library Use**
   - **Hard Success:** The player recalls reading about similar artifacts in an obscure text and quickly identifies it as something dangerous. They also remember a way to neutralize its effects.
   - **Ordinary Success:** The player remembers some vague details about the artifact’s origin but needs more research to fully understand it. The group decides to take the artifact to a safer location for further study.
   - **Failure:** The player cannot recall any useful information about the artifact, leaving the group in the dark about its significance.
   - **Fumble:** The player misremembers critical details, leading the group to believe the artifact is something it’s not, potentially causing them to mishandle it.

Situation: The players are trapped inside a crumbling, abandoned mansion that’s beginning to collapse around them. They need to find a way out before it’s too late.

**Suggested Skills:**
1. **Spot Hidden**
   - **Critical Success:** The player spots a hidden passage that leads directly to an exit, allowing the group to escape quickly and safely.
   - **Hard Success:** The player notices a weak spot in the wall that can be broken through, creating an improvised escape route.
   - **Failure:** The player overlooks potential exits, leading the group into more dangerous areas as they continue searching for a way out.
   - **Fumble:** The player mistakes a dangerous area, like a structurally unsound staircase, for a safe path, causing further damage or injury.

2. **Climb**
   - **Extreme Success:** The player finds a sturdy beam or rope and climbs to a high window, creating a safe escape route for the group. Everyone escapes without injury.
   - **Ordinary Success:** The player manages to climb up to a ledge and helps the others follow, though it takes longer and they barely escape as the building collapses behind them.
   - **Failure:** The player struggles to climb and fails to find a safe route, forcing the group to look for another way out while the building continues to crumble.
   - **Fumble:** The player slips and falls, causing significant injury or dropping something important. The delay could prove fatal as the building collapses around them.

3. **Strength**
   - **Hard Success:** The player uses brute force to break down a blocked door or clear debris, allowing the group to escape just in time.
   - **Ordinary Success:** The player manages to push through obstacles but exhausts themselves in the process, slowing the group down but still getting them out safely.
   - **Failure:** The player cannot move the debris blocking the exit, leaving the group trapped and forcing them to find another way out.
   - **Fumble:** The player’s attempt to force their way through causes a part of the building to collapse further, injuring themselves or others and complicating the escape.

Situation: The players find themselves face-to-face with the leader of a dangerous cult who holds valuable information. They must negotiate to gain his trust or extract the information they need.

**Suggested Skills:**
