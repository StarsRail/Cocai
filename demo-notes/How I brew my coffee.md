I take my coffee seriously, and the brewing process is a ritual that sets the tone for my day. Here's a glimpse into my typical coffee-making routine:

**Coffee Beans**: I always start with high-quality, freshly roasted coffee beans. Whether it's a single-origin or a carefully crafted blend, the beans are the foundation of a great cup of coffee.

**Grinding**: I prefer to grind my coffee just before brewing to preserve the freshness of the flavor. A medium grind works well for my drip coffee maker, ensuring a balanced extraction.

**Water Temperature**: Maintaining the right water temperature is crucial for extracting the best flavors from the coffee. I heat the water to around 200°F (93°C) for optimal extraction without any bitterness.

**Brewing Time**: I've found that a brewing time of around 4 minutes is ideal for achieving the perfect balance of acidity and richness in my coffee. I often use a timer to ensure consistency.

**Milk or Black**: Depending on my mood, I'll either enjoy my coffee black to savor the pure flavors or add a splash of steamed milk for a creamier texture. Occasionally, I'll indulge in a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg for an extra layer of complexity.

Each cup of coffee is a unique experience, and I enjoy experimenting with different beans and brewing techniques to discover new flavors. Cheers to the simple pleasures of a well-brewed cup!
