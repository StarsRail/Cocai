### Lashing Phantoms

Lashing Phantoms are native to a dimensional reality that is coextensive with our own. They are one of the top predators in what amounts to the seas of the world they inhabit, which parallels the earth in many respects. They are man-sized creatures. The body of a lashing phantom looks somewhat like a blend between that of a slug and a gar. Extending from both ends of the body are four long tentacles, two on each end. Instead of a normal head, a lashing phantom has three lamprey-like mouths on its underbody. Each mouth is surrounded by a ring of gelatinous globes that function both as eyes and ears for the lashing phantom. The senses of a lashing phantom are quite acute and enable them to easily find their prey.

Lashing phantoms are both curious and voracious-when they encounter something new, they will eagerly investigate it and then quickly try to eat it, should it prove edible. They attack by lashing at their prey with tentacles and follow this up with biting.

Under normal conditions, the inhabitants of our reality and that of the lashing phantoms’ reality are unaware of the “nearby” presence of each other. Under unusual circumstances, lashing phantoms can interact with this world. In most cases these interactions are very limited; a human might, for example, have a vague feeling of being watched, catch a glimpse of strange movement out of the corner of her eye, or feel a faint touch-like that of a feather dipped in slime. Under truly odd circumstances lashing phantoms can almost fully interact with our world. In such cases the lashing phantom remains partially in its reality which enables it to swim (thus appearing to fly in our reality) and also gives it a phantom-like appearance. Objects and effects in the realm of earth affect lashing phantoms so that they cannot, for example, pass though solid objects such as walls. If they consume something on earth, it becomes part of them and thus goes back with them. If a lashing phantom is killed or captured it will remain on earth unless the conditions that enabled it to interact with the realm of earth come to an end. For example, if a lashing phantom is killed in this adventure it will remain until sunrise or until it is taken out of the area (unless someone volunteers to eat it).

The interface between the realities also makes the lashing phantom seem to be composed of various sized sparkling fragments and to fade in and out, never completing losing all transparency. In fact, a lashing phantom interacting with our reality will seem oddly beautiful right up until the moment it starts tearing savagely into its chosen meal. When seen in this way, there is no sanity loss for viewing them. The usual nature of the light created by their interface with earth’s reality results in photographic images of these creatures being very distorted. For the most part, normal cameras will merely show indistinct blurs. A person with the relevant skills could construct either a special lens filter or a modification to film (or software) to enable the light to be captured properly.

The veil between the two realities is generally fully intact. However, certain types of very unusual radiation can cause the veil to become thin or even part it. The most common cause of such effects is a rare ore that has very unusual properties and seems to partially exist in both realities. The Mi-Go have found various uses for this unusual ore and often seek it. Because of their encounters with lashing phantoms and other creatures of their reality, the Mi-Go have found ways to deal with them.
