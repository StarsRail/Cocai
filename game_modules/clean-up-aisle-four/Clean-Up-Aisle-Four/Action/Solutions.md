### Solutions?

One option is to try to kill the phantoms. There are many, many lashing phantoms in their realm so killing them all is probably not a viable option. However, killing enough of them (for example, killing all that show up for three nights) will deter others from entering the area, at least for a while. Of course, others will blunder into the area in weeks or months, thus starting the problem all over again.

Another option is to seal the area off and keeping people out of danger. The degree of effectiveness will depend on the means used. Naturally, the Zipp N’ Pik company will not be pleased to have the store sealed off and neither will the townspeople.

A third option is to set up microwave generators to keep the creatures away. The radiation can be kept at safe levels and the generators would be fairly simply to construct by someone with the relevant skills. Zipp N’ Pik executives will be willing to accept this option since the radiation levels will be within the legal limits.
