### Outside Action

The Mi-Go device was removed from an area that is located roughly under the center of the store. As such, the lashing phantoms can interface earth’s realm for about fifty feet around the store centering on the store’s center. As such, if someone can make it out of the area they will be safe from the phantoms.

The phantoms tend to end up in the store because it is in an area in which the metal’s effect is the strongest, thus making it easier for them to spot their prey.

During the day, the area is safe from the phantoms. Once night has fallen, the phantoms will be able to sense things in the area and will investigate and attack any living thing they encounter. If the investigators are there, they will be attacked by lashing phantoms (one phantom for every two investigators should be suitable). The phantoms will attack until they each have a meal or until they are badly wounded (at 50% of their hit points) and then they will leave. If a phantom gets a kill, it will take its meal with it-when it leaves the area what it has consumed will come with it.

If no one is in the area, observers might catch glimpses of the phantoms entering the area in search of another meal (after the previous feast the creatures check the area when they hunt) but the phantoms will move on in search of something to eat.
