### Carson

When the investigators arrive in Weyport Carson will have been staking out the convenience store since the day after the incident. Out of a very reasonable fear, she will not enter the store that is, she wonâ€™t enter it until she is worried that another reporter might go into the store and get a great story.

If Carson believes that the investigators are rival reporters, she will sneak into the convenience store at night and most likely end up dead. If the Keeper wants to jump right into the action, she could call the investigators from the store, reporting that strange things are happening and that she has concealed herself in the utilities closet. In this case, if the investigators chose to try to rescue her, they will encounter three lashing phantoms in the store. If they do decide to leave her to her fate, that fate is left to the Keeper.
