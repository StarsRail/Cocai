### The Ghost Pursuers

If the investigators have been brought into the adventure using the reality TV show option, they will be assigned to spend the night in the store (paying a nice fee to the Zipp N’ Pik company). The Keeper can pick the name of the series, perhaps something like “Ghost Pursuit” or something equally silly.

In this case, the investigators will set up for the night’s shooting during the day and then arrive for the action at night. See In the Store below for the events.

If this option is not being used by the investigators, the Keeper can have an NPC team from a reality TV show arrive to do an episode about the store. At the Keeper’s discretion, they can end up in dire danger and need to be rescued by the investigators, end up simply vanishing in the store, or (letting their discretion be the greater part of their valor) they might simply decide to make up a story, film some outside shots and then go home.
