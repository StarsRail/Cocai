### In the Store

If the investigators are in the store at night, it is likely that they will be attacked. The Keeper might wish to have the first night be uneventful or, even better, have only a few harmless denizens of the other realm show up to give the investigators a start and perhaps lull them into a false sense of security. These denizens superficially resemble the lashing phantoms but lack the tentacles and are harmless-they feed on their realm’s equivalent of plankton.

When the lashing phantoms arrive they will “swim” through the area, cautiously checking things out (much like sharks and other predators). They will probably “bump” the investigators a few times to make sure they are edible and then will strike. In terms of their numbers, one phantom for every two investigators should be suitable-unless the investigators are very well or very poorly armed.
