## Weyport

This small coastal town is a sleepy place most of the year, waking up to a brisk pace during the summer tourist season and slowly settling back to a somnolent state after the fall foliage has been entombed within the icy shroud of the New England winter.

Weyport is a typical coastal New England Town. It is in reasonably good economic shape and has a living downtown with a variety of shops, most of which are aimed at the tourists. The town is a short distance away from larger towns (some of which are infested with Wal Marts) and is not far from Boston, thus enabling the investigators to acquire almost anything they might need.
