Weapons: 12 Gauge Shotgun Damage: 4D6/2D6/1D6 Range: 10/20/50 Shots: 8, 9mm Semiautomatic Damage: 1D10 Base Range 20 yards, 15 shots, Night Stick: 1D8+DB Description: John is the police chief of Weyport. He grew up in Boston, but found that he preferred the small town life and took the job two years ago.

John is slightly above average in size, has brown eyes and thinning brown hair. He is a fairly no-nonsense sort of person and will look upon and claims about ghosts, aliens or other weirdness with a great deal of skepticism. He also likes to keep things “by the book” and will not be very tolerant of any “cowboy antics” the investigators might be contemplating. However, he is not a stupid man and will not maintain his skepticism in the face of reasonable evidence. If the investigators show that they have a better grasp on the situation than he does, he will be willing to work with the investigators to protect his town.
