Description: As noted above, Wendy is a young reporter for the *Bangor Daily
News*. As a young reporter fresh from the University of Maine, she generally gets sent to cover local events such as lobster, clam or blueberry festivals. She is already sick of writing cutesy things about claims, so she is hoping this mystery will be her ticket to the big time-the Portland Press Herald or even the New York Times.

Wendy has dark blonde hair and blue eyes. She is a bit heavyset and tries to workout as often as possible because she thinks people will open up to her more if they find her attractive ( she is, of course, completely right). She is quite ambitious and this, combined with her youth, makes her willing to take some serious risks if need be.

While her main focus is on getting a career making story, she is reasonably moral and will act accordingly. She hunted with her brothers and father, so she is familiar with a shotgun. If things seem to be taking a turn towards the weird and the dangerous, she will go to a Wal Mart and buy a 20 gauge pump shotgun and a box of shells.
