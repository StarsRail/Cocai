## Introduction

This modern day adventure pits the intrepid investigators against an evil plaguing a New England convenience store. An evil other than ancient hot dogs and high gas prices, of course. The adventure is intended to be the first in a short series of adventures centering around a convenience store which will be known collectively as “Convenience Store Cthulhu.”

The adventure is also intended as a “starter” adventure and is suitable for new investigators. It does not require that the investigators have any special skills or knowledge and does not pit the investigators against a major mythos threat.
