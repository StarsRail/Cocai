### History

There are numerous mundane history texts that report the basic details of the region. However, the investigators can turn up
*Vanished
Villages*, by Ira Cabot Wiener, published in 1962. This work includes the following about the history of the town:

A little known fact about the scenic Massachusetts town of Weyport is that it is built over the ruins of a failed settlement. In 1623 a band of Englishmen were given a charter to form a colony. Unfortunately for them, they chose to establish their initial settlement in the area that was reported as being shunned by the native tribes. According to some of the legends, the area was said to be plagued by ghosts. Interestingly, these ghosts were said to be particularly vicious and there were tales of them killing both humans and animals. Undeterred by such tales, the settlers established rough shelters and set up crude fortifications.

When the next ship arrived, they found the settlement completely empty. According to a surviving document from the times, the second wave of settlers reported that it seemed as if the settlers had simply walked away with every intent of returning. No sign of fighting or violence was found, but the suspicious English believed that hostile natives had killed the first settlers. The settlers sent the women to an established colony up the coast and, after arming themselves, the men set out in search of revenge. They were never heard from again. A small scouting party from the established colony went to the settlement and found signs that the men had been there, but found it abandoned once again. They decided it was best to simply leave the area alone and departed, leaving the rough buildings to fall into decay.

In 1697 Charles Wey, a down on his luck English adventurer, learned of the failed settlement and managed to talk his way into the ownership of the charter for the area. He found the ruins of the previous settlement and also reported finding “mysterious pits” dug in the ground. Despite the area’s bad reputation, he was eventually able to persuade enough people to move to the area, thus creating a viable colony. The colony eventually grew and became what is now the town of Weyport.

While Weyport is not particularly well known as a haunted place, there are numerous reports of strange sightings in the area. Not surprisingly, most of them are said to have taken place during storms. Some claim that the apparitions are the ghosts of the lost settlers.
