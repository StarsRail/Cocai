### The Store

The store will initially be closed when the investigators arrive in town. If they go there during the day, they will find nothing unusual. If they go there at night, refer to the Action section below.

The store is a standard convenience store. There are gasoline pumps in the front, a glass front with a sliding door, and a main area with a cashierâ€™s station and shelves of convenience store stuff. In the back of the store are the bathrooms, a utility closet, a storage area and a small employee break room. The store is new, so it is in good shape. Naturally, the hot dogs and other items have been shipped in from the warehouses in which they are suitable aged to convenience store standards.
