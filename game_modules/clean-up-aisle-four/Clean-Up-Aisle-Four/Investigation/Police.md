### Police

Weyport has a police chief, John Robinson, and four police officers (Dan Marsh, Julie Roberts, Brent Smith and Robert Parker). There are several police auxiliaries who work during the tourist season, mostly directing traffic on busy days and for events.

The police are, not surprisingly, reluctant to release additional information about the case. This is partially due to the fact that the investigation is ongoing, partially due to their sensitivity to the importance of tourism to the town, and partially due to the nagging doubt that this is some sort of odd hoax or some sort of reality TV event.

If the investigators are able to earn the confidence of the chief or one of the officers (or gain access via some other means) they can gain access to the following information:

First, there are nine people believed to be missing. None of them have any serious police records. The police investigation has not turned up any unusual connections between them and no one seems to have any real motivation to wish them harm.

The Missing:

Second, the police found no overt signs of violence in the store or vehicles. A careful examination using standard forensic techniques revealed nothing unusual. Third, the police have the security tapes. There are a few unusual things about the tapes. First, as night begins to fall the tapes show signs of distortion. If examined by an expert, it will be found that it is most likely due to the effect of some sort of electromagnetic field or radiation. The effect grows stronger as the sun goes down, reaches a plateau during the hours of darkness, and then returns to normal as daylight returns. Second, while the majority of the tape is so distorted a careful observer will (like someone trying to watch scrambled porn on cable) be able to get a faint impression of what was recorded. The general impression will be that there seem to be some images of people moving around as well as some unusual blurred shapes on the film. There will be about one second of film that is less distorted than the rest. This bit shows what appears to be Robert Wainwright hanging in midair with a distorted blur over him. Based on the way his body is positioned, it looks like he is being held by something around one leg, both arms and his upper torso. The investigators might think to have the tapes computer enhanced. Doing this will clear up some of the distortion, but no amount of enhancement will result in anything like a clear image.

The police have some theories. One theory is that this is some sort of bizarre hoax and that the tapes have been deliberately doctored. Another theory is that this is part of some stupid reality TV show in which a town gets a prank played on it by a band of juvenile idiots. The third theory is that something truly awful has happened in the store, be it caused by human agents or something more unusual.
