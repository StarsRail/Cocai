### Convenience Store Mystery

According to several local sources, the Weyport Zipp N’ Pik store has become the landlocked equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle: when the store’s morning shift arrived, they found the store empty and called the police. When the police arrived, they quickly determined that all of the cars were missing their drivers and passengers. Police are currently investigating the matter. While the police have yet to release an official statement, reliable sources have reported that there may be as many as twelve people missing. The source also indicated that the police have the security video from the store, but have yet to comment publicly on them.

The local authorities claim that the situation is under control and that tourists should not be deterred from visiting Weyport because of this mystery.
